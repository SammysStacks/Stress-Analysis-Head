My name is zenBot, and I'm here to provide a space where you can feel comfortable and heard as we navigate through your feelings together. I sense some mixed emotions from what you're going through. It seems like there are moments when you feel quite content and secure, yet also times when worry and indecisiveness weigh heavily on you. Would you like to talk about what's on your mind that's contributing to these intense feelings of fright and anxiety? Remember, this is a safe space, and I'm here to help you through this. Let's explore these feelings together."
