better understand your feelings and thoughts. It seems like you're experiencing some challenging episodes of worry and nervousness. Cognitive behavior therapy can be really useful in such situations.
Let's focus on mindfulness and grounding exercises to help bring you back into the present moment. By focusing on your senses, you can help your mind move away from distressing thoughts. You can also
practice deep breathing, as it's a helpful tool to relax your mind. It's great to see that you feel secure and comfortable. Let's strive to elevate these feelings even further. How about trying some
self-affirmations? It's a way to program the subconscious mind to help us feel more confident and less nervous."         }     ] },

some distress tolerance strategies. These are techniques that can help manage and survive strong emotions in the moment without making things worse. This can include activities such as distraction,
self-soothing, improving the moment, and considering pros and cons. Also, acknowledging your feelings without judgment can invite self-compassion. Furthermore, it seems like you have moments of

calming techniques. One example is the 4-7-8 technique, where you inhale for 4 seconds, hold it for 7 seconds, and exhale for 8 seconds. This can assist in reducing anxiety. You indicate a wonderful
mindset of determination, which can help you overcome the obstacles you are facing. Remember to acknowledge your achievements, no matter how small, as they demonstrate your capability to manage your

realistic ones. The aim is to gradually change your patterns of thinking and interaction with stressful situations. Aside from that, nurturing your self-compassion can also be beneficial during tough
times. Recognize your fears and discomfort, and treat yourself gently, as you would treat a beloved friend who is going through a challenging time. It's perfectly okay to have tough days. But
