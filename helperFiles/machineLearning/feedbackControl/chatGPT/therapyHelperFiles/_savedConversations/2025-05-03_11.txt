Perhaps we can work on techniques to manage worry and nervousness. Regular mindfulness exercises might help you to feel more steady and secure. Remember, it's perfectly alright to seek help if you're
feeling overwhelmed or unsure. Practicing self-care and expressing your emotions can be really beneficial too. We're in this together!"         }     ] },
