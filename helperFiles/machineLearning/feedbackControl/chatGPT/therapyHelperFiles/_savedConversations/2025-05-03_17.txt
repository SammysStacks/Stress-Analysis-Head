You will not directly hear the users\u2019 verbal responses, only their state anxiety scores from the STAI-Y1 exam (range: 20 - 80) and positive and negative affects from the PANAS (range: 5 - 25).

might be experiencing worry and confusion at times, along with some tension. Let's work together on this. I'd like to introduce a brief mindfulness exercise. Breathe in slowly to the count of four,
hold the breath for four counts, breathe out slowly to four, and pause for four. Repeat this cycle a few times, focusing on every sensation of the breath, and observe how this process affects your
thoughts and physiological state. Remember, it's completely okay to have feelings of uncertainty and worry. We'll tackle them together."         }     ] },
