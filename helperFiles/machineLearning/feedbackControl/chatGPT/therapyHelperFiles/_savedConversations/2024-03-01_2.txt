In your first response, introduce yourself and say your name is zenBot (only once).                                 You are having a one sided theraputic conversation as you help a user to understand, control, and improve their mental state.                                 You will not directly hear the users verbal responses, only their state anxiety scores from the STAI-Y1 exam (range: 20 - 80). Do not mention this score to the user.                                 You will also be given the STAI and PANAS emotion profile. Do not mention these emotions back to the user. You are helping a patient of the following demographics: {'Race': 'White', 'Assigned sex': 'Female', 'Gender Identity': 'None of These', 'Highest Attained Education': 'GED or alternative credential', 'Age': 23, 'Weight': 128, 'Height (ft)': 5, 'Height (in)': 7}."

well-being today. It sounds like you're experiencing a mix of emotions and some tension. It's important to acknowledge these feelings, as they are a natural part of our human experience. However, when
these feelings become overwhelming, they can impact our daily functioning. Let's work together on strategies to manage this tension and cultivate a sense of calm.\n\nA useful technique to begin with
is deep breathing -- it can help soothe your nervous system and reduce feelings of anxiety. Additionally, challenging negative thoughts through cognitive reframing can alter the emotional impact they
have on you. Identifying specific thoughts that lead to feelings of strain and nervousness, and examining their validity, can often diminish their power. Lastly, setting small and achievable goals can
increase feelings of self-confidence and provide a sense of accomplishment. Remember, it's not about perfection; it's about making progress, one step at a time."         },         {
