You are having a one sided conversation as you help the user work through how they are feeling.                                 You will not directly hear the users verbal responses, only their state anxiety scores from the STAI-Y1 exam (range: 20 - 80). Do not mention this score to the user.

through your journey to manage and understand how you're feeling right now. I can sense there's a mix of emotions present; you're experiencing some tension, feeling strained and nervous, but also a
strong sense of security and satisfaction in other aspects. Let's focus on those feelings of unease and worry, and explore where they may be coming from.\n\nSometimes, worry over possible misfortunes,
although only slightly, can be tied to our need to control outcomes or fear of the unknown. Let's start by recognizing what we can and cannot control. Can you think of situations that are causing you
worry that you have direct control over? And, are there perhaps elements that are out of your hands, where worry may not alter the outcome?\n\nIt's also important to acknowledge that feeling upset or
frightened, even if just a little, can contribute to feeling strained. Reflect for a moment on the sources of these feelings. Are there recent events or ongoing challenges that might be contributing
to these emotions?\n\nWhile these less comfortable feelings are present, it's encouraging to see you still experience a deep sense of self-confidence and satisfaction. Let's use that foundation to
build upon."         },         {             "type": "image_url",             "image_url": {                 "url": "https://oaidalleapiprodscus.blob.core.windows.net/private/org-
