Yet, there's also a sense of self-confidence present in you, which is a strong foundation to work from. It's natural to feel a complex array of emotions, and it's important that we acknowledge them. Exploring these feelings together can help us understand them better and find ways to manage them. If there's anything specific on your mind that's causing you to feel this way or any particular situation you'd like to discuss, please feel free to share. We can navigate through these concerns at your own pace."
